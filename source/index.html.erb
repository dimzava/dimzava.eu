    <p>
      I'm an agile-minded software engineer turned to manager, with almost a decade of professional experience
      in the field. Over these years, I have taken part in more than 50 projects, small and large, being actively
      involved in the entire software development life cycle both independently and as a member, technical lead/manager
      and scrum master of teams of up to 10 members with diverse backgrounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since 2010 I've been working with
      <%= link_to 'Q&amp;R', 'http://www.qnr.com.gr', :target => '_blank' %> and 
      <%= link_to 'Cedefop', 'http://www.cedefop.europa.eu', :target => '_blank' %>
      to improve the <%= link_to 'Europass', 'http://europass.cedefop.europa.eu', :target => '_blank' %> services. 
      Outside work, you can frequently <%= link_to 'find me', 'https://github.com/dimzava', :target => '_blank' %> 
      on GitHub spending time on various open source and side projects.
